# Exploratory Data Analysis Pokemon Dataset (Kaggle)

An in-depth exploration of Pokemon stats, types, and legendary status using Python & Statistical Analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze the characteristics of 800+ Pokemon to identify patterns in combat stats and type distributions. This analysis helps understand the "meta-game" balance and identifies which features contribute most to a Pokemon's "Legendary" status.

## 📊 Key Insights
* **Type Dominance:** Water and Normal types are the most common, while Ice and Ghost types remain the rarest.
*
* **Average Total Power by Type: Dragon with high average strength but with high Standard Deviation**<img width="2560" height="1600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da373134-b7fb-417b-b440-ab802ece2877" />
* **The Power Gap:** Legendary Pokemon have an average Total Base Stat significantly higher (~600) than non-legendary Pokemon (~400).
* **Correlation map of strengths: **<img width="2560" height="1600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/489e1843-f425-4028-b729-9c137286c363" />

* **Stat Correlations:** There is a strong positive correlation between Defense and Special Defense, but a surprising lack of correlation between Speed and Weight.
* **Attack Distribution Water Vs fire :**<img width="622" height="401" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-12 at 16 38 22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64aecc07-8c0e-45f7-bd5b-70e6538570be" />

* **Generational Shift:** Generation 1 has the highest variance in stats, while later generations show more balanced distributions.
