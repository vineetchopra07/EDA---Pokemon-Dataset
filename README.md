# Exploratory Data Analysis Pokemon Dataset (Kaggle)

An in-depth exploration of Pokemon stats, types, and legendary status using Python & Statistical Analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze the characteristics of 800+ Pokemon to identify patterns in combat stats and type distributions. This analysis helps understand the "meta-game" balance and identifies which features contribute most to a Pokemon's "Legendary" status.

## 📊 Key Insights
* **Type Dominance:** Water and Normal types are the most common, while Ice and Ghost types remain the rarest.
* **The Power Gap:** Legendary Pokemon have an average Total Base Stat significantly higher (~600) than non-legendary Pokemon (~400).
* **Stat Correlations:** There is a strong positive correlation between Defense and Special Defense, but a surprising lack of correlation between Speed and Weight.
* **Generational Shift:** Generation 1 has the highest variance in stats, while later generations show more balanced distributions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Statistical Analysis**
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Kaggle Notebooks

## 📂 Data Source
The data was sourced from the [Kaggle Pokemon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon). It includes stats like HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, and Type for all Pokemon across 7 Generations.
